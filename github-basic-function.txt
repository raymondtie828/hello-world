Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
- Default branch known as 'main'

- Create a new branch called 'filename-edits'.
- In this case, I use 'readme-edits'

Making and committing changes
- Open 'readme' file by using Github Desktop.
- Make changes on Readme file
- In the commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
- Click commit changes.
*These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch,
so now this branch contains content that's different from main.

Opening a pull request
- After save changes in the Text Editor, the changes will be updated automatically in the Cloned Github Desktop.

Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.
- When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review
and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
- Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.
- The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

- Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.

Your collaborators can now review your edits and make suggestions.

Merging your pull request
In this final step, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch.

1. Click Merge pull request to merge the changes into main.
2. Click Confirm merge.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, by clicking Delete branch.
